# YouBank

This was a school (SKP - skolepraktik) project.

This was a group project and we needed to make - an mobile app, web app, Rest API and host it all. I was given task to create this website and helped a little bit in creating the API. The idea for this website is that is should idtroduce users to your mobile banking app.</br>

### System requirements were: </br>

SPA page which will inform and guide to the app.
* Splash page
* Contact
* Support / FAQ
* Terms & Privacy </br>
<b>Extras: </b>
* Login
* User profile / User Creation
* Darkmode
* Multilanguage
* Animations 

This website was made in React JS and I added small animations/motions to some elements with the help of <b>framer-motion</b> package and <b>intlt</b> for multilanguage support. Also I made a darkmode which users can toggle (and language) in the header. Also I tried to make it responsive for it to look good also in mobile devices.


Here you can see how it looks:
